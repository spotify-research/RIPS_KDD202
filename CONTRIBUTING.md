## Pull Requests

Comments should be formatted to a width no greater than 80 columns.

Files should be exempt of trailing spaces.

We adhere to a specific format for commit messages. Please write your commit
messages along these guidelines. Please keep the line width no greater than 80

    RIPS_KDD2020: One line description of your change (less than 72 characters)

    Problem

    Explain the context and why you're making that change.  What is the problem
    you're trying to solve? In some cases there is not a problem and this can be
    thought of being the motivation for your change.

    Solution

    Describe the modifications you've done.

    Result

    What will change as a result of your pull request? Note that sometimes this
    section is unnecessary because it is self-explanatory based on the solution.

Some important notes regarding the summary line:

* Describe what was done; not the result 
* Use the active voice 
* Use the present tense 
* Capitalize properly 
* Do not end in a period â€” this is a title/subject 
* Prefix the subject with its scope

## Documentation

We also welcome improvements to the project documentation or to the existing
docs. Please file an [issue](https://RIPS_KDD2020/issues/New).
